quicktoc-vim
============

Qucktoc-vim generates tables of contents from LaTex and Markdown documents and displays them in the location list window. The location list entries can be selected to quickly jump to the various sections and subsections of the current document.

There are 2 ways to generate the table of contents: commands and key bindings. The commands are:

    :QuickTocLatex
    :QuickTocMarkdown

A quicker way is to hit **\<localleader\> c** when editing a Latex or Markdown document.

Installation
------------

This plugin is written in pure vimscript and does not depend on any external programs. The recommended installation method is via pathogen:
